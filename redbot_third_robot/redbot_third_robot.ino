RedBot Library_Test

 This is a simple hardware/library use demo for the RedBot. All it does
 is print accelerometer and sensor data over the serial port, while
 waiting for a tap on the accelerometer. When the accelerometer is tapped,
 it drives forward a few inches.

//include the redbot library to get the functions out of the library

// Instantiate the motor control class. This only needs to be done once
//  and indeed SHOULD only be done once!
RedBotMotor motor;



void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);//This will open the serial port to send values out to calibrate sensors

  Serial.println("Hello world!");//This should print once to make sure you're getting serial communication

}

void loop()
{  

  
    motor.pivot(100);   // turn a bit

    delay(750);         // wait for stop to finish
    
    motor.pivot(-100);   // turn the other way a bit

    delay(750);         // wait for stop to finish

  
}
